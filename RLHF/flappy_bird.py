# cl: python use pytorch lib & RLHF   write  to AI  play flappy Bird Games

## Here's a basic outline of how you could use PyTorch and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) to create an AI agent that plays Flappy Bird:

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np
import flappy_bird_gym  # Assuming you have a Flappy Bird environment

# Define the neural network
class FlappyBirdNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(FlappyBirdNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(4, 64)  # Input: bird's y, velocity, next pipe's x and y
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, 2)  # Output: probabilities of flap and do nothing

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        return torch.softmax(self.fc3(x), dim=-1)

# Initialize the environment, model, and optimizer
env = flappy_bird_gym.make("FlappyBird-v0")
model = FlappyBirdNet()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)

# RLHF training loop
for episode in range(1000):  # You can adjust the number of episodes
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    episode_reward = 0

    while not done:
        # Get action probabilities from the model
        state_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(state)
        action_probs = model(state_tensor)
        
        # Sample action
        action = np.random.choice([0, 1], p=action_probs.detach().numpy())
        
        # Take action in the environment
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        
        # Get human feedback (you would implement this part)
        human_feedback = get_human_feedback()  # This function needs to be implemented
        
        # Combine environment reward with human feedback
        combined_reward = reward + human_feedback
        
        # Calculate loss
        loss = -torch.log(action_probs[action]) * combined_reward
        
        # Backpropagate and update the model
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        
        state = next_state
        episode_reward += reward

    print(f"Episode {episode + 1}, Reward: {episode_reward}")

# Save the trained model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "flappy_bird_model.pth")
