# CL: how to define this train data?

Certainly, defining training data for a Tetris-playing AI is an important step. In reinforcement learning, we don't typically use a predefined dataset. Instead, the agent learns from its interactions with the environment. However, we can define how we structure and collect this interaction data. Here's how we can approach this:

1. State Representation:
   We need to define how we represent the game state. This could include:
   - The current board configuration
   - The current piece
   - The next piece (if visible)
   - Current score
   - Level

2. Action Space:
   We've already defined this in our code (left, right, rotate, down), but we might want to expand it.

3. Reward Structure:
   We need to define how we reward the agent. This could include:
   - Points for clearing lines
   - Penalties for game over
   - Small rewards for successfully placing a piece

4. Experience Collection:
   We'll use a technique called Experience Replay. Here's how we can modify our code to better define and collect this "training data":

```python
class TetrisEnv:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board = np.zeros((20, 10))
        self.current_piece = self.new_piece()
        self.next_piece = self.new_piece()
        self.score = 0
        self.level = 1
        
    def new_piece(self):
        # Return a random piece
        return np.random.randint(0, 7)
    
    def get_state(self):
        # Return the current state of the game
        return {
            'board': np.copy(self.board),
            'current_piece': self.current_piece,
            'next_piece': self.next_piece,
            'score': self.score,
            'level': self.level
        }
    
    def step(self, action):
        # Perform action and return new state, reward, done
        # Action: 0 - left, 1 - right, 2 - rotate, 3 - down
        reward = 0
        done = False
        
        # Implement game logic here
        # Update board, score, level
        # Check for cleared lines and update reward
        # Check for game over and set done flag
        
        return self.get_state(), reward, done

class TetrisAgent:
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size):
        # ... (previous init code) ...
        self.memory = deque(maxlen=100000)  # Increased memory size
    
    def remember(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        # Store experience in memory
        self.memory.append((state, action, reward, next_state, done))
    
    def get_state_tensor(self, state):
        # Convert state dict to tensor
        board = torch.FloatTensor(state['board']).flatten()
        current_piece = torch.FloatTensor([state['current_piece']])
        next_piece = torch.FloatTensor([state['next_piece']])
        score = torch.FloatTensor([state['score']])
        level = torch.FloatTensor([state['level']])
        return torch.cat((board, current_piece, next_piece, score, level))

    def act(self, state):
        if np.random.rand() <= self.epsilon:
            return random.randrange(self.action_size)
        state_tensor = self.get_state_tensor(state).unsqueeze(0)
        act_values = self.model(state_tensor)
        return np.argmax(act_values.cpu().data.numpy())
    
    def replay(self, batch_size):
        minibatch = random.sample(self.memory, batch_size)
        for state, action, reward, next_state, done in minibatch:
            target = reward
            if not done:
                next_state_tensor = self.get_state_tensor(next_state).unsqueeze(0)
                target = reward + self.gamma * np.amax(self.model(next_state_tensor).cpu().data.numpy())
            state_tensor = self.get_state_tensor(state).unsqueeze(0)
            target_f = self.model(state_tensor)
            target_f[0][action] = target
            loss = self.criterion(self.model(state_tensor), target_f)
            self.optimizer.zero_grad()
            loss.backward()
            self.optimizer.step()
        if self.epsilon > self.epsilon_min:
            self.epsilon *= self.epsilon_decay

# Training loop
env = TetrisEnv()
state_size = 20 * 10 + 4  # board + current_piece + next_piece + score + level
action_size = 4  # left, right, rotate, down
agent = TetrisAgent(state_size, action_size)

episodes = 10000
batch_size = 64

for e in range(episodes):
    state = env.get_state()
    total_reward = 0
    for time in range(1000):  # max 1000 steps per episode
        action = agent.act(state)
        next_state, reward, done = env.step(action)
        agent.remember(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        state = next_state
        total_reward += reward
        if done:
            print(f"episode: {e}/{episodes}, score: {state['score']}, total_reward: {total_reward}")
            break
        if len(agent.memory) > batch_size:
            agent.replay(batch_size)

# Save the trained model
torch.save(agent.model.state_dict(), "tetris_model.pth")
```

In this updated version:

1. We've expanded the state representation to include more information about the game.
2. The `remember` function now stores this richer state representation.
3. We've added a `get_state_tensor` function to convert our state dictionary into a tensor for the neural network.
4. The training loop now runs for more episodes and steps, allowing the agent to gather more diverse experiences.
5. We're tracking and reporting both the game score and the total reward received during training.

This approach allows the agent to learn from a wide variety of game states and outcomes, effectively creating its own training data through interaction with the environment. The "training data" is stored in the agent's memory and used for learning through the replay mechanism.
